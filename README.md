# SAS-Code
School coding projects and GRA code

This repository provides a few examples of my coding experience in SAS. Some projects are class projects analyzing real-world datasets, some are
homework assignments providing the scope of my coding knowledge, and some are self-made codes for my GRA projects. Note: The GRA projects are 
coded so that those with little to no experience with SAS can change the data input and run the code to generate reports seamlessly.
